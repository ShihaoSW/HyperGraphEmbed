## Embedding General Sparse Hypergraphs with Non-uniformity and Multiplicity

Codes in the repo reporduce the results in [A general latent embedding approach for modeling non-uniform high-dimensional sparse hypergraphs with multiplicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12108) using R. 

**Folders and files**:
- **`cocitation_network/`**  
  Contains the code and data for the co-citation hypergraph analysis. See the folder for details.  

- **`HGraphEmbed.zip`**  
  An R package implementing hypergraph embedding with Rcpp.  

- **`coverage_result.R`**  
  Code to reproduce the inference results reported in the paper.  

- **`functions_limit.R`**  
  Utility functions used in `coverage_result.R`.
